# Control Flu Data Collection
Control Flu Team - 2015/2016

## Specific instructions

You are digitally recording Control Flu program data. You are creating spreadsheets (in ".csv" form).  Each data entry person should create no more than one spreadsheet per school (but if multiple interns work on one school, that's fine).  

Each row in the spreadsheet you are creating refers to A STUDENT WHO RETURNED A CONSENT FORM (regardless of whether the response was "y" or "n").  Students who did not return a consent form will not be present in this dataset.

#### Use  

1. Review the variable explanation table at: https://github.com/joebrew/data_collection/blob/master/variable_explanation.csv  
2. Download the template.csv from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joebrew/data_collection/master/template.csv.  You can save it to your computer by right-clicking anywhere in the document and selecting "Save as...".
3. Enter data
4. Follow the variable explanation form.  If there are irregularities, note these irregularities in the "comments" column only.
5. When finished, make sure to name and save your spreadsheet appropriately (see below) and email to Andrew (alampert@ufl.edu).

#### Naming conventions
Use the following naming convention for all forms: ?[schoolname]_[internlastname].csv?.  For example ?littlewood_brew.csv?.  

If you are dealing with an ambiguous name (ie, there are multiple schools of the same name), clarify.  Ie: "alachua_es_brew.csv".

#### File format
Keep file as a ".csv" file.  Do not save as a ".xls" or any other kind of format.

#### Security
You are dealing with protected health information.  Keep data safe and encrypted.  Be vigilant and careful.
